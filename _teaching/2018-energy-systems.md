Current energy conversion systems are submitted to a growing demand in terms of flexibility. This flexibility requires an accurate characterization of the components dynamic behavior under varying boundary conditions, which in turns allows to set up optimal control strategies.
This course is an introduction to the dynamic modeling of thermal systems. It teaches the bases of the Modelica language through theoretical and exercise classes.
