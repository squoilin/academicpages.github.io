This first blog post marks the opening of my personal page which summarizes my academic activities. The site is based on [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/) Jekyll template and is hosted by github pages. The source code is available in my personal [github space](https://github.com/squoilin).

At the time of writing these lines, the site is still under construction. It will be completed in the coming weeks with more detailed descriptions of my research projects.

The blog will also be updated when new relevant information can be shared (which might occur on an irregular basis)
