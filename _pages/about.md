I am an assistant professor at the KU Leuven (Belgium) and at the University of Liège. I conduct research in the field of Smart Energy Systems and on the transition towards clean and renewable energy production. 

In the course of my work I created and lead development of various open-source modelling tools, such as ThermoCycle, Dispa-SET or GPExp. 



Research topics
------

Smart Energy Systems:
* Modelling the deployment of high shares of renewables
* Heat integration into energy systems
* Rural electrification and microgrids

Sustainable power generation: 
* Organic Rankine cycles
* Combined heat & power (CHP) 
* Industrial waste heat recovery

Heating, Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and energy in buildings:
* Testing and modeling HVAC components: compressors, cooling coil, heat pumps.
* Demand response through thermal appliances


Teaching
------
At the University of Leuven:
* Sustainable energy systems
* Energy systems design and simulation

At the University of Liège:
* [Introduction to the dynamic modeling of thermal systems](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/archives/20132014/cocoon/en/cours/MECA0514-1.html)
