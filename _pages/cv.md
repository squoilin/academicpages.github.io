Sylvain Quoilin is an assistant professor in the field of Energy Systems. His research focuses on the optimization of power systems, on self-consumption and on the integration of high share of Renewables. His teaching activities include a Dynamic Modelling class as well as the supervision of PhD students and several master students each year. He gained a strong international experience with several stays in foreign research groups (MIT, TU München, University of Antwerp, JRC) working on similar topics. His activities relevant to the present project can be summarized by: - 3 years experience within the Joint Research Centre (EU Commission) on decentralized storage, self-consumption and flexibility of power systems - Author and co-author of more than 100 publications in conference proceeding and journals on the topic - Main developer of a ToolBox to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of Self-Consumption - Main developer of Dispa-SET, a power system model used to evaluate flexibility in EU power systems - Several ongoing studies on PV self-consumption with decentralized storage or demand response (+ overall impact on the system)
